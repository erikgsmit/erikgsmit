- 👋 Hi, I’m @erikgsmit
  
- I study computer science at KTH in Stockholm, which is also where i live. I am currently embarking on my second year.

- I’m interested and passionate about coding. When I am not coding I enjoy playing various sports and video games and thus
  my projects are often related to such things. I like finding inspiration for my projects from my everyday life and I am always
  keen on developing my programming skills.
  
- I’m currently learning C++ but also tend to do a lot of projects in Python

- 📫 You can preferably reach me on my mail: erikgsmit@gmail.com
