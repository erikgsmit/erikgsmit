- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @erikgsmit
- 
- Iâ€™m interested and passionate about coding. When I am not coding I enjoy playing playing various sports and video games and thus
  my projects are often related to such things. I like finding inspiration for my projects from my everyday life and I am always
  keen on developing my programming skills.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ but also tend to do a lot of projects in Python

- ðŸ“« You can preferably reach me on my mail: erikgsmit@gmail.com
